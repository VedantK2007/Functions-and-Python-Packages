# Functions
# ---------
# Math Definition: inputs provide outputs
# Programming Definition: take in inputs (parameters) and return values
# Why do we use functions?
# Break up code into manageable chunks
# The ability to reuse code rather than copy and pasting it.
# Makes the code more organized.

# No parameters


# Return function


# Python Packages
# Python comes with libraries. Libraries/Packages in Python contain useful functions that we can use to make writing code easier for us.
# Ex. random, turtle, example games
# To use a library in Python we call the import statement
# Ex. import random
# Ex. import turtle



# def multiplyNum(number1, number2):
#   output = int(number1) * int(number2)
#   return output

# number1 = input("Enter your first number here: ")
# number2 = input("Enter your second number here: ")

# print(multiplyNum(number1, number2))



# import turtle
# wn = turtle.Screen()
# Z = turtle.Turtle()
# # Forward/backward units of measurement in pixels
# Z.forward(50)
# # for left/right movement units of measurement in angles
# Z.left(90)
# Z.forward(50)
# Z.right(90)
# Z.backward(50)
# Z.right(90)
# Z.forward(50)
# Z.speed(1)

import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
Z = turtle.Turtle()

Z.forward(30)
Z.left(110)
Z.forward(50)
Z.left(140)
Z.forward(50)
